_**Sptula** is to navigate web pages using the headless Chromium browser through the PuppeteerSharp library. The **script** extracts email addresses from the visited pages and provides the option to save these addresses to a file. Additionally, it allows the use of **proxies** for anonymized browsing._

1. **User Interface:**
    - _Prompts the user if they want to use a proxy for browsing_
    - _Asks the user to enter a starting URL and a limit on the number of pages to visit._
    - _Optionally asks if they want to save the extracted email addresses to a file._

2. **Proxy Management:**
    - _Allows the user to specify a proxy in the format type://host:port (e.g., socks5://127.0.0.1:1080)._
    - _Validates the operational status of the proxy via a test HTTP request._
